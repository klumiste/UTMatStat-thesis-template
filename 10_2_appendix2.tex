Brief basics of writing style are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Always think of your reader when you are writing and proceed
  logically from general to specific. "Write your thesis so that it would be understandable by your non-mathematician friend", Jüri Lember and "There is no such thing as too much explanation", Jüri Lember
  \item Highlight your key points, for example, by discussing them in
  separate chapters or presenting them in a table or figure. Use
  \textit{italics} or \textbf{boldface} for emphasis, but don't overdo
  it!
\item Avoid long sentences and complicated statements. A full stop is
  the best way to end a sentence.
\item Use active verbs to make a dynamic impression but avoid the
  first person pro-noun ``I'', except in your preface.
\item Avoid jargon and wordiness. Use established terminology and
  neutral language.
\item The minimum length of chapters and sub-chapters is two
  paragraphs, and you need to consider the balance of
  chapters. Paragraphs must always consist of more than one sentence.
\item Do not use more than three levels of headings, such as 4.4.2.
\item Do not use too many abbreviations. Use capital and small letters
  consistently.
  \item Use \LaTeX for your thesis, \href{https://amrys.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/why-your-should-latex-your-dissertation-or-why-you-dont-have-to-write-your-dissertation-in-word/}{because of reasons}! Compile your document as often as possible. Debugging a \LaTeX document can be a nightmare, but if you at least know the last 4-5 steps that you took, then you can at least roll-back to latest working version.
  \item Use a good \LaTeX Editor! It will save you a lot of time and spare some nerve cells.
  \item In case of many formulas in the thesis and frequent cross-referencing between sections, then consider using equations numbering that includes the section number in front (instead of equation label (3) you will have (1.3) where 1 refers to the section where this formula is found). For this use the following command before \verb_\begin{document}_ statement:
  \begin{verbatim}
      \numberwithin{equation}{section}
  \end{verbatim}
  

  \item Be responsible for every word you write! This is Your thesis.
\end{itemize}

Sometimes ending a section with list is considered as bad
style. Therefore, it is better to have some text after it.
