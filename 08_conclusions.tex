\section*{Conclusions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusions}  


The last chapter of a thesis is the Conclusions (some authors use
Conculsion, instead).  Keep it short, and discuss what one can
conclude about the thesis statement or research question given in the
Introduction, in light of all that has been written in the thesis.
The Conclusion is also the place to discuss any limitations and
weaknesses of the thesis (especially those that cast doubt on the
reliability of the results given in the thesis), if they have not been
already discussed, for example in a Discussion chapter.  It is also
customary to state, what further research might be beneficial in light
of this thesis.

If the Conclusions threatens to become too long, it is a good idea to
split the interpretation of the results into its own chapter, often
called Discussion, making Conclusions short and sweet.

After Conclusions, there is the bibliography.
