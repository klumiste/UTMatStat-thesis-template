\section*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}  

The main text of a thesis always starts with an ``Introduction''.
You can leave writing it to the final phase of writing.

It is a good idea to start the Introduction with the main thesis
statement or research question of the thesis.  After that, it is a
good idea to clarify things by defining any necessary
terms.\footnote{Definitions after the thesis statement!  Also, don't
  babble in the introduction.}  This section is also a good place
to discuss why your thesis statement is scientifically or practically
relevant and interesting. Introduction is the place where you explain what is 
your contribution -- knowledge that you have investigated or produced 
personally. At the end of the section, it is customary to briefly
explain the structure of the thesis -- what each chapter is about.
